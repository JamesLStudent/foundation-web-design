        <p>
            The King of Rock. The King of Electric Guitar. The Voice of Queen. Musical royalty. 
            Each artist revolutionised music in their time. Now, thanks to the power of AI and digital
            hologram technology, their reign begins anew, in the studio and on the stage. We're very
            pleased to announce the latest and greatest group to take the world of music by storm all
            over again: The Monarchy.
            <br><br>
            Following in the legacy of the legendary 2012 Coachella, in which Tupac Shakur took to the 
            stage 15 years after his death thanks to the work of an Academy Award-winning visual effects
            studio, these three icons are returning to perform again, but in an all-new group and with
            all-new music. Stay tuned.
