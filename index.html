            The King of Rock. The Master of the Electric Guitar. The Voice of Queen. Musical royalty. 
            Each artist revolutionised music in their time, and now they're back; the band of the 
            century has emerged: The Monarchy. A mesmerizing collaboration of AI holograms featuring the legendary 
            voices and personas of Freddie Mercury, Jimi Hendrix, and Elvis Presley. Together, these 
            iconic figures from different eras have been resurrected through advanced artificial 
            intelligence, captivating audiences around the globe with their electrifying performances. 
            As their holographic forms shimmer on stage, the undeniable magnetism and raw talent of 
            Mercury, Hendrix, and Presley coalesce into an otherworldly synergy, transporting spectators 
            to an unparalleled realm of musical experience. Their familiar melodies and passionate 
            energy leave audiences spellbound, reminding us of the indelible impact these legendary 
            artists have had on the world of music, while igniting a new era where the past intertwines 
            seamlessly with the future.
            <br><br>
            Following in the legacy of the legendary 2012 Coachella, in which Tupac Shakur took to the 
            stage 15 years after his death thanks to the work of an Academy Award-winning visual effects
            studio, these three icons are returning to perform again, but in an all-new group and with
            all-new music. Stay tuned.
